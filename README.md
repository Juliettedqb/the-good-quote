"The Good Quote"

This project was built by 3 web developers in training at Ada tech school. We had to create a chrome extension and were free to do anything we wanted. Sky was the limit. 

Our first goal was to build an ad blocker that would work on any website. We quickly realised that this was very ambitious and maybe a bit out of our reach. 

We brainstormed and decided that what we wanted most of all was to have fun and end each day with a functional version of our extension. Because it was so difficult to target ads, we decided to target images. 

Our MVP : an extension that removes images and displays a quote using the "Quotes" API found on rapidapi.com

In time, we replaced all images with llamas, injected some html (when you hover on a llama, facts about llamas appear and disapear when your mouse leaves the llama), added a toggle and styled the quotes. 

In the future, we would like to add options, make it work only on the active tab and adapt it to other browsers. 

This is not a very serious project but we had a lot of fun building it and learned a lot !
