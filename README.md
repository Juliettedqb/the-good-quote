"The Good Quote"

This project is a chrome extension built by 3 web developers in training at Ada tech school. 

Our first goal was to build an ad blocker that would work on any website. We quickly realised that this was very ambitious and a bit out of our reach. Because it was so difficult to target ads, we decided to target images. 

Our MVP : an extension that removes images and displays a quote using the "Quotes" API found on rapidapi.com

In time, we replaced all images with llamas, injected some html (when you hover on a llama, facts about llamas appear and disapear when your mouse leaves the llama), added a toggle and styled the quotes. 

In the future, we would like to add options, make it work only on the active tab and adapt it to other browsers. 

This is not a very serious project but we had a lot of fun building it and learned a lot !
